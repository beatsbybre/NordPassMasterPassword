# NordPassMasterPassword
VBScript to Input Master Password into NordPass

Change <masterpassword> to your MasterPassword before execution.
  
Have assumed that the default path of NordPass.exe is located within AppData\Local\Programs\nordpass of C:\Users\Username. Have assigned a variable strUserName and called the %USERNAME% environment string to hopefully make the script run natively.
